GitHub Release Setup Instructions
=================================

To complete your auto-update system setup, you need to add secrets to your GitHub repository.

STEP 1: Add GitHub Actions Secret
---------------------------------
1. Go to: https://github.com/ZubairHussainK/smis/settings/secrets/actions

2. Click "New repository secret"

3. Add this secret:
   Name: ENCRYPT_KEY
   Value: smis_secure_update_key_2024

STEP 2: Create the Release
--------------------------
The Git tag has been pushed, but to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow,
you need to create an actual GitHub Release:

1. Go to: https://github.com/ZubairHussainK/smis/releases

2. Click "Create a new release"

3. Choose tag: v2.0.0 (should be available)

4. Release title: "SMIS v2.0.0 - Auto-Update System"

5. Copy and paste this description:

6. Check "Set as the latest release"

7. Click "Publish release"

STEP 3: Verify Setup
--------------------
After creating the release, GitHub Actions should automatically:
- Build your application with PyInstaller
- Create an encrypted installer
- Upload it to the release

You can monitor progress at:
https://github.com/ZubairHussainK/smis/actions

STEP 4: Test the System
-----------------------
1. The next time someone runs your app, it will check for updates
2. If v2.0.0 is newer than their version, they'll see an update dialog
3. The update will download, decrypt, and install automatically

SUCCESS! 🎉
Your SMIS application now has a complete auto-update system!

Future releases:
- Just update version.py
- Create new GitHub release
- GitHub Actions handles everything automatically

🚀 MANUAL WORKFLOW TRIGGER GUIDE
================================

ISSUE: Release created but workflow didn't run
SOLUTION: Manually trigger the GitHub Actions workflow

📋 3 WAYS TO TRIGGER THE WORKFLOW:

METHOD 1: MANUAL TRIGGER (EASIEST)
----------------------------------
1. Go to: https://github.com/ZubairHussainK/smis/actions
2. Click on "Build and Release Windows Application" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" button (top right)
4. Select branch: main
5. Click "Run workflow" green button
6. Wait ~15 minutes for completion

METHOD 2: RE-PUBLISH EXISTING RELEASE
-------------------------------------
1. Go to: https://github.com/ZubairHussainK/smis/releases/tag/v2.0.2
2. Click "Edit release" 
3. Uncheck "Set as the latest release"
4. Click "Update release"
5. Edit again and check "Set as the latest release" 
6. Click "Update release" - this should trigger workflow

METHOD 3: DELETE AND RECREATE RELEASE
-------------------------------------
1. Delete current release: https://github.com/ZubairHussainK/smis/releases/tag/v2.0.2
2. Create new release:
   - Tag: v2.0.2 (already exists)
   - Title: "SMIS v2.0.2 - Auto-Update System"
   - Description: (any description)
   - Check "Set as the latest release"
   - Click "Publish release"

🔧 WHAT THE WORKFLOW WILL DO:
1. ✅ Checkout code from your repository
2. ✅ Setup Python 3.11 environment
3. ✅ Install dependencies from requirements.txt
4. ✅ Update version in application files
5. ✅ Build executable with PyInstaller
6. ✅ Create installer package
7. ✅ Encrypt installer with your ENCRYPT_KEY
8. ✅ Upload encrypted installer to release

📊 SUCCESS INDICATORS:
- Green checkmark in GitHub Actions
- Encrypted .exe file appears in release assets
- File size ~50-100MB
- No error messages in workflow log

⏱️ EXPECTED TIMELINE:
- Workflow start: ~30 seconds
- Build process: ~10-12 minutes
- Upload: ~2-3 minutes
- Total: ~15 minutes

🎯 MONITORING LINKS:
- Actions: https://github.com/ZubairHussainK/smis/actions
- Release: https://github.com/ZubairHussainK/smis/releases/tag/v2.0.2
- Workflow runs: Check for "Build and Release" runs

⚠️ TROUBLESHOOTING:
If workflow still doesn't trigger:
1. Check repository settings > Actions > General
2. Ensure "Allow GitHub Actions" is enabled
3. Check "Workflow permissions" are set to "Read and write"

✅ RECOMMENDATION: Use METHOD 1 (Manual Trigger)
It's the fastest and most reliable way!

🔍 TROUBLESHOOTING MISSING EXE FILE
===================================

ISSUE: Release created but no .exe file available for download

CAUSE: GitHub Actions workflow didn't run or failed

SOLUTION STEPS:

1. CHECK GITHUB ACTIONS STATUS:
   Go to: https://github.com/ZubairHussainK/smis/actions
   Look for workflow run with tag v2.0.0

2. MOST LIKELY MISSING SECRET:
   The workflow needs ENCRYPT_KEY secret to build the installer
   
   ADD SECRET:
   - Go to: https://github.com/ZubairHussainK/smis/settings/secrets/actions
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Name: ENCRYPT_KEY
   - Value: (your encryption key from config/update_config.py)

3. RE-TRIGGER THE WORKFLOW:
   
   OPTION A - Delete and recreate release:
   - Go to: https://github.com/ZubairHussainK/smis/releases
   - Delete the current v2.0.0 release
   - Create new release with same v2.0.0 tag
   
   OPTION B - Re-run failed workflow:
   - Go to: https://github.com/ZubairHussainK/smis/actions
   - Find the failed workflow run
   - Click "Re-run jobs"

4. VERIFY WORKFLOW FILE:
   Your .github/workflows/build-and-release.yml should trigger on:
   - Release publication
   - Should have all required steps

EXPECTED WORKFLOW STEPS:
✅ Checkout code
✅ Setup Python
✅ Install dependencies 
✅ Run PyInstaller
✅ Encrypt installer
✅ Upload to release

COMMON ISSUES:
❌ Missing ENCRYPT_KEY secret
❌ Workflow not triggered on release
❌ Build errors in PyInstaller
❌ Permission issues

NEXT ACTIONS:
1. Add the ENCRYPT_KEY secret (CRITICAL)
2. Delete current release
3. Create new release 
4. Monitor GitHub Actions progress

SUCCESS INDICATORS:
✅ GitHub Actions shows green checkmark
✅ Workflow completes all steps
✅ Encrypted .exe appears in release assets
✅ File is downloadable

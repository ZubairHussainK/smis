✅ WORKFLOW SYNTAX ERROR FIXED!
===============================

ISSUE: Invalid workflow file with duplicate parameters
FIX: Removed duplicate 'draft' and 'prerelease' definitions

🔧 WHAT WAS FIXED:
- Duplicate 'draft: false' removed
- Duplicate 'prerelease: false' removed  
- Workflow file now validates properly
- Ready for manual triggering

📋 NOW YOU CAN TRIGGER THE WORKFLOW:

STEP 1: Go to GitHub Actions
https://github.com/ZubairHussainK/smis/actions

STEP 2: Click "Build and Release Windows Application"

STEP 3: Click "Run workflow" button (top right)

STEP 4: Select branch: main

STEP 5: Click green "Run workflow" button

STEP 6: Wait ~15 minutes for completion

🎯 EXPECTED RESULT:
- Workflow runs successfully (green checkmark)
- Builds SMIS application with PyInstaller
- Creates encrypted installer 
- Uploads to v2.0.2 release
- You get downloadable .exe file!

⚠️ IMPORTANT:
The workflow file is now completely fixed:
✅ No syntax errors

✅ Manual trigger enabled

🚀 READY TO GO!
Your SMIS auto-update system is ready for deployment!
